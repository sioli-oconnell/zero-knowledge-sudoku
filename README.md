# Zero-Knowledge Sudoku Solutions
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are these interesting cryptographic schemes where someone
can prove a statement without giving away any information except for the fact
the statement is true.

The problem is that these schemes can be difficult to understand. The code in
this repo is a toy implementation of a scheme that proves that someone knows a
solution to a Sudoku puzzle without giving away the solution. I wrote it so
that I could better understand how these schemes work. Hopefully it's useful
to someone else too :)
